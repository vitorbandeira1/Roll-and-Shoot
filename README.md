# Roll-and-Shoot


Roll and Shoot is a thrilling and fast-paced game where you race against the clock to complete a track filled with obstacles. As you navigate through the course, hostile enemies impede your progress, slowing you down upon contact. However, armed with a powerful weapon, you can shoot them down to gain extra time. Oh, strange blue circles can make you go faster, but be careful, sometimes they are way too fast!! 

Conquer the track!
